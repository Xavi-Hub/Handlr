# Handlr - work in progress
Handlr is an iOS app that makes sharing your social media handles and other contact information easy.

When a user wants to exchange contact information with a friend, they simply open the app and present the QR code provided. The friend can scan the code to receive all the contact information the user has entered, and save it to their own app.

The user can customize information they'd like to share when they meet someone new (Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, phone number, etc).
